    <h1>About Arbstack</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Arbstack is a market-intelligence layer that helps users understand
      <strong>where markets disagree</strong> — before they bet, trade, or predict.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Sports betting and prediction markets all price the same events,
      but they speak different languages.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prediction markets quote probabilities in cents or percentages</li>
      <li>Sportsbooks quote American odds with built-in margin (vig)</li>
      <li>Fans are forced to compare numbers that were never designed to align</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a result, users see odds — but they do not see
      <strong>confidence gaps</strong>, <strong>bias</strong>, or
      <strong>mispricing</strong>.
      The most valuable information lives in the disagreement between markets,
      and it is usually invisible.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Arbstack’s Insight</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Disagreement itself is information.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      When independent markets price the same outcome differently,
      at least one of them is wrong — or early.
      Arbstack does not predict outcomes.
      It surfaces where confidence diverges so users can ask better questions.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>The EPL Board</h2>
    <p>
      The English Premier League page is the first live demonstration of Arbstack.
      For every match, it shows three independent market views side-by-side:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Kalshi</strong> — prediction market pricing shown as team-vs-team probability (cents)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Polymarket</strong> — crowd-driven three-way probabilities (win / draw / loss)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SportsLine</strong> — bookmaker odds converted into clean split probabilities
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All formats are normalized so they can be compared directly.
      No odds are hidden. No numbers are averaged away.
    </p>

    <h2>What Users Learn</h2>
    <p>
      Before placing a bet or making a prediction, a user can immediately see:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Which matches markets broadly agree on</li>
      <li>Which matches show strong disagreement</li>
      <li>Whether bookmakers or crowds are more confident</li>
      <li>Where bias, overreaction, or delayed information may exist</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Arbstack shifts the question from:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Who should I bet on?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      to:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Why do these markets disagree — and who is most likely wrong?”
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>What Arbstack Is — and Is Not</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not</strong> a betting platform</li>
      <li><strong>Not</strong> a tipster or prediction engine</li>
      <li><strong>Not</strong> an odds aggregator</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Arbstack is a <strong>decision-quality tool</strong>.
      It makes uncertainty explicit and lets users decide how to act.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Arbstack’s long-term vision is to become the place users visit each day to ask:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Where does the market disagree today — and why?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Sports are the starting point.
      The same framework applies to politics, economics, and any domain
      where probabilities are traded and belief diverges from reality.
